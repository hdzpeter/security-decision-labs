**Initial Access Vector Benchmarks**

Cross-source vector proportion data (`data/reference/vectors/initial_access_vectors.json`) is compiled from:
- DBIR 2025/2026 (Verizon, 22,052/31,861 incidents)
- Palo Alto Unit 42 IR Reports 2025/2026 (500/750 engagements)
- Google/Mandiant M-Trends 2026 (500k+ IR hours)
- CrowdStrike Global Threat Report 2026 (EDR telemetry)
- Beazley Q3 2025 Threat Briefing (cyber insurance claims)
- IBM Cost of a Data Breach 2025 (600 organizations)

Each record includes extraction provenance, source verdicts, bias propagation tags, and quality tier assessments. All values were manually verified from source PDFs.

Additional data sources (Coalition, DShield, CISA KEV, EPSS, Ransomware.live, FBI IC3) are documented with full citations in the embedded JSON data files and in `docs/technical-reference.md`.

Users must comply with the respective licenses and terms of use for all data sources.
