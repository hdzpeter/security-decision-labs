[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-green)]()
[![Methodology](https://img.shields.io/badge/Methodology-FAIR-blue)]()

Data-grounded Threat Event Frequency estimation with vector decomposition. Produces defensible TEF estimates for FAIR risk quantification by decomposing threat frequency into four initial access vectors.

**Features:** Four-vector decomposition (exploitation, credential, phishing, supply chain), three-anchor base rate triangulation, cross-vector dampening (VERIS-calibrated), credibility blending with org telemetry, web UI, CLI, continuous telemetry monitoring

**Install:** `pip install tef-estimator` · [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tef-estimator/)

[![Python 3.10+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10%2B-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Five-dimension psychometric validation framework for LLM-generated classifications. Tests whether an LLM's outputs are reliable enough to trust, using the same statistical methods applied to human raters.

**Features:** Coherence (inter-rater kappa), consistency (rule-based checks), convergent validity (reference comparison), adversarial discrimination (minimal pairs), stability and sensitivity (paraphrase invariance), interactive dashboard, configurable thresholds, bootstrap confidence intervals

**License:** CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (Non-Commercial Use Only)
